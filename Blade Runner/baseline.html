  The baseline test was an examination designed to measure any emotional deviance by Nexus-9 replicants.<br>
  To be "off baseline" would be considered a failure of such test.
</p11><br><br>

<p11>
  Unlike its predecessor, the Voight-Kampff Test,<br>
  the baseline test was conducted by an unseen questioner who recited the examination through a machine opposite the subject under questioning.<br>
  Throughout the exam – which was rather short in comparison to the Voight-Kampff Test – the questions, with the intonation and tempo in which they were asked, were rather impersonal.
</p11><br><br>

<p11>
  The length and content of the test was based on the replicant's response time, becoming longer if their response was slow in the first few lines and using more of the poem.
